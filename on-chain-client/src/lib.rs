//! Read-only client for the `OrgRegistry` contract on Asset Hub via
//! `pallet-revive`. See the design at
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-13-ods-phase-1b-design.md` (§3 covers
//! this crate's public surface; §5.2 lists the integration test scenarios
//! that gate Stage 2) as amended by
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-04-ods-phase-1b-stage2-subxt-commitment-design.md`
//! (single transport stack: subxt).
//!
//! Build modes:
//!
//! - `default = ["dev-rpc"]`: std + subxt over jsonrpsee. Used by
//!   integration tests against a chopsticks fork.
//! - `--no-default-features`: `no_std + alloc`. Types, decoders and
//!   verifier only; no client available.
//! - `--no-default-features --features smoldot`: std + subxt's smoldot
//!   light client. Used by the Phase 1.c PWA and the live-Paseo smoke test.
