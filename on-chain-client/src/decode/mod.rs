//! Runtime-version-gated storage and event decoders. Each pinned Paseo AH
//! runtime version gets its own submodule (e.g. `v_paseo_ah`),
//! exhaustively fixture-tested against bytes constructed from a known
//! input shape. A `Decoder` trait + `dispatch::for_runtime` picks the
//! right impl at runtime based on the version reported by
//! `Rpc::runtime_version`.
//!
//! Risk #1 in the design doc (pallet-revive is pre-stable, both as a
//! pallet and a storage/event shape) is the reason these are
//! version-gated rather than written against a single assumed layout.
//!
//! Storage and event input shapes:
//!
//! - **Storage:** the caller (`OrgRegistryClient::get_org_state` in
//!   Task 5) issues three `chainHead_v1_storage` reads against the
//!   contract's slots `S`, `S+1`, `S+2` where
//!   `S = keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(admin), uint256(0)))`. The three
//!   32-byte slot values are concatenated and handed to
//!   `Decoder::decode_org_state` as one 96-byte blob.
//! - **Events:** the input is the SCALE-encoded payload of a
//!   `pallet_revive::Event::ContractEmitted { contract, data, topics }`
//!   variant — i.e. the bytes *after* the outer `RuntimeEvent` variant
//!   discriminant has been peeled off. `Decoder::parse_revive_event`
//!   returns `Ok(None)` for a log whose first topic matches no signature
//!   this decoder knows; that is normal because the follow subscription
//!   delivers every contract's events on one stream. Filtering by
//!   emitting contract is the caller's check, on the address returned in
//!   `EmittedEvent` — a matching signature hash says nothing about which
//!   contract emitted the log.
