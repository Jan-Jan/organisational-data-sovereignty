# Traceability gates (exit 1 with one line per violation):
#   MISSING-TEST ID          — REQ or LLR with no `verifies:` reference in
#                              test_paths. A REQ also counts as tested when a
#                              tested LLR `satisfies:` it (transitive).
#                              Never annotate a test that does not verify the
#                              behavior. Put an LLR test at the software item's
#                              own interface.
#   UNMITIGATED-HAZARD ID    — HAZ with no RC `mitigates:` line naming it.
#                              Instead of a new RC, record the acceptability
#                              rationale and control in the RMF.
#   UNIMPLEMENTED-CONTROL ID — RC with no REQ `implements:` line naming it.
#                              For a non-software control, note the external
#                              implementation in the RMF item. Add an
#                              implementing REQ only if software is part of it.
#   UNTRACED-DESIGN ID       — SDD whose block has no `traces:` REQ reference
#   UNSATISFIED-LLR ID       — LLR whose block has no `satisfies:` naming a
#                              REQ and is not marked `satisfies: derived`
#   UNANALYZED-DERIVED ID    — REQ/LLR marked derived that no `assesses:`
#                              line in the RMF names. Several items may share
#                              one `assesses:` line.
#   DANGLING-REF ID          — ID referenced in docs/strict/test paths but
#                              defined nowhere. Deleting a defined item is a
#                              change that needs its own review.
#   DANGLING-FILE FILE       — a `DRAFT-<name>.md` ledger file (name
#                              characters [A-Za-z0-9_.-]) named in a doc_*
#                              file, by path or bare name, that does not exist.
#                              Usual causes: a draft another change merged and
#                              renamed, or a draft in another unit.
#                              finalize-docs.sh does not rewrite a relative
#                              link, a name in emphasis or a name joined to a
#                              longer word. Plans and verification records are
#                              not scanned. A reference to an existing draft
#                              passes. A bare name resolves against this unit's
#                              ledger directories only; across units, write the
#                              path.
#   MISPLACED-ITEM ID        — item defined outside the document configured
#                              for its prefix. Adding the stray file to
#                              strict_paths does not fix it. A doc_* directory
#                              resolves to its *.md files one level deep; a
#                              single-file doc_* resolves whatever its
#                              extension. Indent an illustrative ID or keep it
#                              inline. Never leave a definition form such as
#                              `**REQ-NNN**:` at the start of a line: that is
#                              MALFORMED-ID (check-ids.sh).
#   NON-RECIPROCAL-SUPERSESSION ID — `supersedes: Y` with no `superseded-by:`
#                              naming it back on Y, or the reverse. The pair
#                              merge-change step 6a prescribes, and ONLY the
#                              pair: this is not a sweep for stale references
#                              to a superseded ID, and existence is
#                              DANGLING-REF's. Each predecessor in a list is
#                              judged alone. If the two IDs are not a
#                              replacement pair, remove both halves and state
#                              the relationship in prose.
#   ORPHAN-ANNOTATION FILE:LINE — a status:/opened:/disposition:/traces:/
#                              satisfies:/supersedes:/superseded-by: line at
#                              column one, or at column one after a list
#                              marker, that belongs to no item block. Wider
#                              than every reader on purpose: a form no reader
#                              takes is still reported where it is orphaned.
#                              Three cases: before the first item in the file;
#                              under a heading with no item since; inside a
#                              block whose prefix's gate does not read the
#                              keyword, usually the wrong item. Move a
#                              separating heading before the item, or drop it.
#                              Indent an illustrative line with no list marker,
#                              or keep it inline in backticks. Reported per

#                              doc_sad and doc_srs, supersedes:/superseded-by:

#                              verifies: and assesses: are read line-wise and
#                              cannot be orphaned.
#   UNRESOLVED-PR ID         — problem report with status: open, with its age.
#                              WARNING only: listed for review,
#                              never fails the check on its own
#   ACCEPTED-PR ID           — problem report with status: accepted, containing
#                              its opened: date and its disposition:. WARNING
#                              only, and exempt
#                              from STALE-PROBLEM and from problem_open_max —
#                              a decision is not a backlog — but never exempt
#                              from this roll-call. Never set accepted to make
#                              PROBLEM-BACKLOG pass; resolve-problem §4 states
#                              the form.
#   INCOMPLETE-PROBLEM ID    — PR with no column-one status: in its block — a
#                              bulleted one is not read, and is not a status —
#                              an OPEN one with no opened:, or an ACCEPTED one
#                              with no disposition: or no opened: (a keyword
#                              with an empty value counts as absent). A
#                              resolved item needs no opened:, so in an
#                              existing ledger backfill it on open and accepted
#                              items only.
#   MALFORMED-STATUS ID      — status: whose value is not one of open,
#                              accepted or resolved
#   MALFORMED-DATE ID        — an open or accepted PR whose opened: is not a
#                              YYYY-MM-DD calendar date, or is more than a day
#                              ahead of today (one day is allowed for clock
#                              skew). An accepted item ages against no limit,
#                              but the date still records when the problem was
#                              raised, and the roll-call prints it. The age
#                              is computed in local time from
#                              `date +%Y-%m-%d`; tomorrow counts as 0 days old.
#   MALFORMED-SUPERSESSION ID — a column-one supersedes: or superseded-by: in
#                              an item block whose value contains no item ID,
#                              the empty value included, OR whose list contains
#                              a token in a declared prefix that is not an ID
#                              beside ones that are. Reported rather than read
#                              as no supersession — or as half of one. Prose
#                              or a parenthetical after the ID list ends the
#                              list and is not reported.
#   STALE-PROBLEM ID         — open longer than problem_age_days (more than).
#                              Set accepted where the item is real but its fix
#                              belongs to another change; resolve-problem
#                              requires the ruling first.
#   PROBLEM-BACKLOG          — more open PRs than problem_open_max (more than).
#                              The count includes open items with no usable
#                              opened: and excludes items whose status cannot
#                              be read.
#
# Scoped (multi-unit) runs add:
#   NON-EXPORTED-REF ID      — reference to an item defined in a declared
#                              dependency but not `exported: yes` there
#   UNDECLARED-DEPENDENCY ID — reference to (or expects: naming) a unit that
#                              is not in this unit's depends_on
#   UNMET-EXPECTATION        — an expects: REQ its provider has not yet
#                              answered with an exported satisfies: REQ.
#                              Advisory inside its aging budget; exit 1 past
#                              expectation_age_days, and on every run when the
#                              expectation implements a risk control
#   INCOMPLETE-EXPECTATION ID — an expects: the reader cannot use: empty
#                              value, a non-REQ carrier, or no usable opened:
#   MISEXPORTED-ITEM ID      — exported: with any value but yes, or on a
#                              non-REQ item
#   EXPECTATION-BACKLOG      — more open expectations than expectation_open_max
#
# Scoped runs engage only when .guardrails/units.yaml exists and GR_CONFIG
# names a declared unit's config (gr_unit_engage in lib.sh). With no manifest
# every path below is byte-identical to the single-unit script; with a
# manifest and no unit config the run is rejected (exit 2) rather than scoped
# by guesswork.
#
# Each doc_* config value may be a single file or a directory of per-change
# dated *.md files (see gr_doc_files in lib.sh).
#
# Nothing here may pass vacuously. These are all environment errors (exit 2),
# never empty results:
#   * a doc_*, strict_paths or test_paths entry matching no file present in
#     the working tree;
#   * a ledger directory containing no *.md at all;
#   * an id_prefixes entry that is not a bare identifier — it is interpolated
#     into every scan pattern, and a scan that errors finds nothing;
#   * an unrecognised config key, a key that is not `identifier:` at column
#     one, a list item at column zero, or a UTF-8 BOM — each is invisible to
#     the config reader, so the gate that key configures never runs;
#   * an id_prefixes list naming none of REQ/HAZ/RC/SDD/LLR/PR, or a declared
#     prefix whose gate inputs are unconfigured, or one whose definition
#     document is unconfigured — every item of that prefix would be misplaced.
#     An extra prefix alongside those is fine — DANGLING-REF, DUPLICATE-ID and
#     ID finalization are keyed on the whole prefix list, so it is checked,
#     just not by a gate of its own.
#
# Annotation rule: for verifies:/mitigates:/implements:/satisfies:/traces:/assesses:,
# only the ID list immediately following the FIRST occurrence of the keyword
# counts. The run ends at the first character that is not an ID, comma or
# space, so `verifies: REQ-001 (was REQ-042)` credits REQ-001 alone. The rule
# has exactly one definition — GR_AWK_ID_RUN in lib.sh.
#
# Every run ends with `checked:` (items found per prefix), `problems:` (open
# count, accepted count, oldest open item, and both triage limits — whether or
# not they are set) and `sources:` (the document files read, then the number of configured
# path entries — one entry may be a directory or a pathspec), so a pass over
# zero cannot be mistaken for a pass over sixty-three, and a limit switched
# off cannot be mistaken for a limit met. MISPLACED-ITEM is what makes `checked:`
# trustworthy: while it is green, every item counted there is in a document
# some gate actually opened. It covers the six gated prefixes only — an extra
# prefix has no configured document and is not placement-checked, so an item
# of one is still counted without being examined.
#
# After the violation lines and before `checked:`, one `fix <RULE>: <remedy>`
# line per rule that fired, warnings included, in the order the rules first
# fired (D8 of docs/plans/2026-09-28-agent-first-skills.md).
# check_trace_remedy below is the remedy table; tests/remedies.bats checks that
# it has one entry per report in the roster above.

# --- MISPLACED-ITEM: an item must be defined inside its own document -------

# stating the consequence were both disproved by the same run that printed
# them, and the honest version has too many exceptions for one line:
#
#   * the item is still ENUMERATED — ids_defined scans the whole tree, so
#     MISSING-TEST, UNMITIGATED-HAZARD and UNIMPLEMENTED-CONTROL fire on a
#     misplaced item exactly as on a placed one;
#   * its own block is not PARSED by the gate that would convict it on those
#     annotations: UNTRACED-DESIGN, UNSATISFIED-LLR, UNRESOLVED-PR and the
#     derived-assessment scan read only the configured document, so a
#     misplaced SDD keeps no `traces:` obligation and a misplaced PR can never
#     be reported open;
#   * but DANGLING-REF scans every doc_* file plus strict_paths and
#     test_paths, so an item misfiled into ANOTHER ledger still has its
#     reference IDs read — by that gate, not by its own;
#   * and a HAZ block contains no annotation of its own that a gate parses, but
#     moving it out of the RMF still blinds one: UNANALYZED-DERIVED reads
#     `assesses:` lines over $rmf_files, so a derived item assessed inside a
#     HAZ block stops being assessed when that block leaves. It fails RED, so
#     no false green — but the loss is real.
#
# What is true for all six is the rule itself: an item belongs in the files
# its key resolves to. The exceptions above are stated where there is room for
# them — the MISPLACED-ITEM entry in the header roster above, and README.md.
# `**SDD-001**:` in docs/design.md passed with no `traces:` at all, and moving
# that same file into doc_sad turned the run red without changing a character
# of it.
#
# "Outside" means outside what gr_doc_files RESOLVES: for a directory, its
# *.md files one level deep; for a scalar, that one file whatever its
# extension. A `.txt` in a configured DIRECTORY, or a `.md` one level
# further down, is outside it — hence the message naming the files the key
# resolves to rather than the key's value, and not naming *.md, which is
# wrong for a single-file doc_* config.

# --- DANGLING-FILE: a draft ledger file named in a ledger must exist --------
# finalize-docs.sh rewrites references to the files it renames, over exactly
# these files. What it cannot reach is convicted here: a reference contained in
# another worktree when the draft's own change merged and renamed it, or a
# reference in another unit's ledger, which that unit's finalize never
# scanned. Resolve, never ban — a reference to a draft that EXISTS is the
# in-flight state of every unmerged change, and a gate on the prefix alone
# would fire on every worktree doing this correctly.
#
# Scope is the rewrite's scope and not strict_paths (D3, 2026-09-08): plans
# and verification records narrate the rename, and "created as DRAFT-x.md"
# is a true sentence that must stay true. The token must look like a real
# file name, so the grammar placeholder `DRAFT-<branch>-<slug>.md` in the
# shipped ledger READMEs matches nothing. A path-shaped reference resolves
# from the repository root and then from the referencing file's own
# directory, so the relative link a markdown renderer actually follows is not
# convicted while its target exists (review finding 4). Each arm's message
# names the places it looked rather than asserting the file exists nowhere:
# in a manifest repository a path written relative to another unit's root
# resolves against neither root, and "does not exist" would be false of it
# (findings 19 and 22). A bare basename resolves against every ledger
# directory, because a bare name is how authors cite a sibling ledger.
#
# The token class is the ledger grammar's — letters, digits, underscore, dot,
# hyphen — so a draft named outside it (a + or @ in the slug) is not looked
# for; finalize renames any DRAFT-*.md, so this is narrower than the rename,
# deliberately: widening it to any non-space character makes prose match
# (review finding 18). A bare name resolves against THIS config's ledger
# directories: in a manifest repository a bare reference to another unit's
# draft is reported even while that draft exists, because a bare name across
# units is ambiguous — the path form resolves (finding 19).

# --- Problem-report triage --------------------------------------------------
# UNRESOLVED-PR is the roll-call and stays a WARNING: the known-problem review
# it serves is a review, not a prohibition, and an item under the configured
# limits does not fail the run. What DOES fail is an item the roll-call cannot
# state truthfully, and a backlog past a limit the project set for itself.
#
# The reader was rewritten here for one reason. It used to be
#
#     cur != "" && /status:[ \t]*open/ { open = 1 }
#
# — unanchored, matched anywhere in the line, and therefore reading a `status:`
# occurrence that check_orphans below CANNOT SEE, because that backstop reports
# a keyword only where a keyword could be read at all. ORPHAN-ANNOTATION
# exists to catch annotations belonging to no item; a reader looking where the
# backstop does not reopens the hole it closed. Worse, an item whose `status:`
# line the pattern missed — `Status: open`, `status : open`, no `status:` line
# at all — read as RESOLVED and vanished from the roll-call: an open problem no
# merge would ever see. Measured on a real ledger, one item in 159 was in
# exactly that state.
#
# So: gr_kw_here — column one and nothing else, first occurrence in the block
# wins, value from a closed set. Anchoring alone would move the false green
# rather than remove it, which is why the missing-status: violation ships in
# the same change.
#
# COLUMN ONE AND NOTHING ELSE is what the rule rests on, and the pairing with first
# occurrence is what makes it so. A reader that also accepted a leading list
# marker was tried and rejected in review: a block quoting `- status: resolved`
# in its prose, above its own column-one `status: open`, handed the reader the
# quotation, and the open item left this roll-call at exit 0 — the very failure
# the rewrite above removed, restored by the widening. check_orphans below is
# wider, and that direction is safe: it reports, it does not read. The
# invariant, stated once in lib.sh at gr_kw_here, is backstop-contains-reader.
#
# Ages are whole days in LOCAL time, from `date +%Y-%m-%d`; the arithmetic
# itself is exact (GR_AWK_CIVIL in lib.sh). A one-day disagreement about what
# "today" is, on the other hand, is NOT immaterial in one place: `opened:`
# tomorrow would otherwise be a hard failure on a correct item. One day of
# tolerance is allowed there and clamped to age 0 — see gr_prflush. Two local
# dates differ by more than one only when the offsets differ by more than 24
# hours, which no pair of real timezones does.
#
# Each line is `W <age> <text>` or `F 0 <text>`: W is the roll-call warning and
# contains the age so the summary can report the oldest, F fails the run. The
# split is made in awk, which knows the limits, and the shell only aggregates —
# a `while read` over a pipe runs in a subshell here, where a `fail=1` would be
# lost. An age of -1 means the item is open and cannot be dated.

# --- ORPHAN-ANNOTATION: an annotation that belongs to no item --------------
# The backstop to the block rule, and the reason that rule can be relaxed
# safely. Blocks now end at a header shape rather than at any bold line,
# which fixes the case that was reported — but every termination rule has an
# outside, and the outside is where this defect lived. An annotation before the
# first item in a file, or under a heading with no item since, belongs to
# nothing under ANY rule. Until this gate it was read, matched, and dropped in
# silence: `status: open` on such a line left the item open in the ledger and
# absent from the known-problem review, with the run still exiting 0.
#
# Scope is per keyword, and only where that keyword is BLOCK-parsed:
# `mitigates:`, `implements:`, `verifies:` and `assesses:` are read line-wise
# by ids_matching, never against a block, so they cannot be orphaned. Reporting
# them anyway — or reporting `status:` from the SRS, where nothing reads it —
# would be noise, and noise is what teaches people to read past the output.
#
# Column one, or column one after one or more list markers, bulleted or
# ordered: gr_kw_orphan_here, which is WIDER than the gr_kw_here every reader
# uses, and deliberately so. The invariant is a containment — the backstop must
# see at least what every reader sees — and never an equality. Widening the
# readers to match this instead was tried and rejected: the readers are
# first-occurrence-wins, so a wide reader lets a QUOTED `- status: resolved`
# outrank the item's own column-one `status: open`. lib.sh states both
# regressions at gr_kw_here.
#
# Wider costs nothing here. This gate REPORTS; it takes no value and decides
# no item's state, so a bulleted annotation outside every block is reported
# whether or not a reader would have taken it — which is the PR-h3wujj defect,
# since gr_id_run reads `- satisfies: REQ-001` inside a block and nothing at
# all saw it outside one.
#
# A line with NO marker is tested unchanged, and that is what keeps the
# indented item grammar shipped in templates/problems.md inert — the property
# that makes this gate adoptable without editing every ledger that already
# exists. It is the absence of a marker that keeps illustrative prose quiet,
# never its indentation.

# half-applied supersession was found by a human reading every site that named
# the old ID, or not at all. On the change that first used the form downstream,
# six sites were half-applied and it took two review rounds to find them.
#
# Reciprocity is the half a gate can prove. This is NOT a sweep for stale
# references to a superseded ID — an `affects:` line may name an old ID as
# history, so that has no unambiguous verdict — and existence is already
# DANGLING-REF's job, which scans every doc_* file.
#
# Column-one keyword via gr_kw_here, IDs via gr_id_run: the same pairing
# status:/opened: use, so this is a READER and stays narrow. The
# ORPHAN-ANNOTATION backstop reads these two keywords wider — column one after
# one or more list markers as well — which is the containment lib.sh states at
# gr_kw_here and not a disagreement: a bulleted `- supersedes: REQ-001`, or an
# ordered `1. supersedes: REQ-001`, records no supersession here, and is
# reported where it belongs to no item at all.
#
# Occurrences ACCUMULATE within a block rather than first-one-wins — the
# annotation is a LIST and a second such line in the same block adds to it —
# because an item may replace more than one predecessor, and each predecessor
# is judged on its own: one applied half must not answer for a missing one.
# Downstream, five of six sites were correct.
#
# `supersedes:` is not a prefix of `superseded-by:` — they part at the ninth
# character — so neither keyword's index() test can read the other's line.
#
# The canonical key is REPLACEMENT<TAB>REPLACED, built from both directions,
# which is the whole reason the two relations are comparable at all.
#
# PLACED LAST, after the triage scan and the orphan backstop, and that is not
# arbitrary. This scan opens every file both of those open, and an unreadable
# ledger is a hard exit 2 in whichever scan reaches it first. Two tests pin
# WHICH scan names it — "an unreadable problems ledger fails the run rather
# than finding nothing" wants the triage scan's message, and "an unreadable
# architecture ledger fails the orphan scan" wants the backstop's, on the one
