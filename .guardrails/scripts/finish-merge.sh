#
# The guarded tail of the signed merge command (merge-change step 7):
#
#   git commit -S -F <msgfile> && sh .guardrails/scripts/finish-merge.sh <branch>
#
# The user runs the compound. Its first half is a plain `git commit -S` they can
# read, because that is the step their hardware key answers for and it must not
# be hidden behind a wrapper. Its second half is this script, because an `&&`
# chain cannot guard anything, and what follows is `git branch -D` on a branch
# git does not consider merged — a squash leaves no merge base, so `-d` would
# refuse and `-D` is the only spelling available. Nothing in a chain stands
# between a subtly incomplete squash and unrecoverable work; this does.
#
# Four guards, all proved before anything is removed:
#
#   1. check-signing.sh --strict passes on HEAD. Always --strict: the default
#      mode passes a signature it cannot verify, and cleaning up on that is a
#      gate answering a question nobody asked.
#   2. `git diff --quiet HEAD <branch>` — merge-change step 1 already merged the
#      base branch into the change branch, so a correct squash leaves the two
#      trees identical. A difference is work the squash did not capture.
#   3. `git worktree remove` WITHOUT --force — git's own refusal of a dirty
#      worktree is the guard.
#   4. No registered worktree lies INSIDE the one about to be removed. Numbered
#      last because it was added last; proved before guard 3, because guard 3's
#      removal is the destructive act it exists to prevent. Guard 3 delegates to
#      git, and git's refusal cannot see a nested worktree: task worktrees live
#      at `.worktrees/<change-branch>-t<N>` inside the change worktree, that
#      directory is gitignored, so the change worktree's `git status` is clean
#      and the removal takes the nested worktree's uncommitted work with it at
#      exit 0 — leaving a `prunable` registration and an orphan branch behind.
#
# A failing guard exits non-zero having removed nothing and deleted nothing. The
# signed commit always survives; only cleanup is refused, which is a safe thing
# to refuse. The fix is to run this script again ON ITS OWN — re-running the
# whole compound cannot double-commit (the squash is no longer staged, so
# `git commit` fails and `&&` short-circuits), but it wastes a key touch.
#
# There is no --force and no way to skip a guard. That is the entire point.
#
# Exit codes: 0 cleaned up, 1 a guard refused, 2 usage/environment error.

    # ESCAPE-PROCESSES the value on its way into the program: `-v inside='w\top/'`

    # backslash therefore made the prefix test match nothing, `$nested` come
    # back empty, and this guard PASS — after which guard 3 removed the change
    # worktree and took the nested worktree's uncommitted work with it, at exit
    # 0. Every other refusal in this script fails CLOSED and merely withholds
    # cleanup; this is the one whose failure loses work, so it is built out of
