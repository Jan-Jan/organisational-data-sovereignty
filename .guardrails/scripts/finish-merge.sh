# finish-merge.sh [--check] <change-branch>
#
# The guarded tail of the signed merge command (merge-change step 7):
#
#   git commit -S -F <msgfile> && sh .guardrails/scripts/finish-merge.sh <branch>
#
# The user runs the compound. Its first half is a plain `git commit -S` they can
# read, because that is the step their hardware key answers for and it must not
# be hidden behind a wrapper. Its second half is this script, because an `&&`
# chain cannot guard anything, and what follows is `git branch -D` on a branch
# git does not consider merged — a squash leaves no merge base, so `-d` would
# reject it and `-D` is the only spelling available. Nothing in a chain stands
# between a subtly incomplete squash and unrecoverable work; this does.
#
# Four guards, all proved before anything is removed:
#
#   1. check-signing.sh --strict passes on HEAD. Always --strict: the default
#      mode passes a signature it cannot verify, and cleaning up on that is a
#      gate answering a question nobody asked.
#   2. `git diff --quiet HEAD <branch>` — merge-change step 1 already merged the
#      base branch into the change branch, so a correct squash leaves the two
#      trees identical. A difference is work the squash did not capture.
#   3. `git worktree remove` WITHOUT --force — git's own rejection of a dirty
#      worktree is the guard.
#   4. No registered worktree lies INSIDE the one about to be removed. Numbered
#      last because it was added last; proved before guard 3, because guard 3's
#      removal is the destructive act it exists to prevent. Guard 3 delegates to
#      git, and git's own check does not detect a nested worktree: task
#      worktrees are at `.worktrees/<change-branch>-t<N>` inside the change
#      worktree, that directory is gitignored, so the change worktree's `git
#      status` is clean and the removal takes the nested worktree's uncommitted
#      work with it at exit 0 — leaving a `prunable` registration and an orphan
#      branch behind.
#
# A failing guard exits non-zero having removed nothing and deleted nothing. The
# one exit 1 that follows a removal is a failed `git branch -D` after guard 3
# removed the worktree; its message states that the worktree was removed. The
# signed commit always remains; only cleanup is rejected, which is a safe thing
# to reject. The fix is to run this script again ON ITS OWN — re-running the
# whole compound cannot double-commit (the squash is no longer staged, so
# `git commit` fails and `&&` short-circuits). With nothing staged, git exits
# before it invokes the signing program, so no key touch is spent either.
#
# There is no --force and no way to skip a guard. That is the entire point.
#
# `--check` (`-n`) answers guard 4 AND NOTHING ELSE, before the squash exists
# and from anywhere in the repository — including the change worktree, where
# the rest of this script will not run. It removes nothing and deletes
# nothing. Guards 1 and 2 both read the squash commit, so neither can be
# preflighted at all; guard 3 IS the removal and cannot be proved without
# doing it. Guard 4 is the one that is fully knowable in advance, and it is
# also the one whose rejection used to cost a wasted key touch to discover.
#
# Exit codes: 0 cleaned up (or, with --check, guard 4 would pass — or had
# nothing to inspect, which the verdict states in those words), 1 a guard
# rejected (or would reject), 2 usage/environment error.
