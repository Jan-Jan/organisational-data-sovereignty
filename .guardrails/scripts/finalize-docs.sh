#
# Renames this change's draft ledger files to their finalize-dated names:
#   docs/<area>/DRAFT-<branch>-<slug>.md -> docs/<area>/<finalize-date>-<slug>.md
# Prints one "before -> after" line per rename. Then rewrites every
# root-relative path and every bare name that refers to a renamed file across
# the ledger directories and the SOUP file, printing one "rewrote FILE: old ->
# new" line each (and "would rewrite" under --dry-run). Under --dry-run a
# reference inside a draft that is itself being renamed is reported under the
# draft's own name, since the preview runs before the rename. Plans and
# verification records are never touched: they narrate the rename, and a true
# sentence about history must stay true. A bare name glued to a longer token
# or wrapped in emphasis (aDRAFT-x.md, _DRAFT-x.md_) is not rewritten either —
# it is not the file's name — and check-trace.sh reports it after the merge.
# Then scans the WHOLE tree for each old basename and prints one
# "unrewritten FILE:LINE: NAME" block per occurrence the rewrite pass did not
# reach ("would leave unrewritten" under --dry-run) — a plan or a verification
# record naming the draft. Informational only: the exit status does not move,
# and which of those is a narration to leave and which a link to repair by hand
# is the author's judgment, not this script's.
# Idempotent: with no draft ledger files present it prints nothing.
#
# There are no IDs to finalize. An item is given its ID by new-id.sh when it is
# written, and that ID is allocated against nothing, so nothing has to be
# assigned at merge. Draft ledger FILES are a different problem and remain:
# a change writes its own file so that parallel worktrees never touch one, and
# the date it is finalized under is this script's own run date — merge-change
# step 3, within a few days of the merge, and not re-derived afterwards. The
# filename is a handle for finding the file, not a record of when it merged;
# the merge date is in git.
#
# This script was called finalize-ids.sh until the token scheme was merged. It was
# renamed rather than left with a name for work it no longer does.
#
# Exit codes: 0 success, 2 usage/environment error.
# A die during the rewrite pass leaves the renames done (staged for a tracked
# draft, plain-moved for an untracked one), every reference rewritten before
# the die rewritten, and the rest as they were; a re-run is the silent no-op,
# so recovery is to fix the remaining references by hand — check-trace.sh's
# DANGLING-FILE names each one.

# rewrite_file FILE OLD NEW BARE PROBE — replace every literal occurrence of
# OLD in FILE by NEW. Exit 0 when something was (or, under --dry-run or
# PROBE=1, would be) rewritten, 3 when nothing qualifies, 2 on any failure.
# Three answers, because two of them look alike from the outside and mean
# opposite things: "nothing to do" and "could not do it".
#
# BARE=1 is the bare-basename pass: an occurrence preceded by "/" is the tail
# of a path to some OTHER file that shares the basename — a sibling unit's
# draft under the same branch name is the realistic shape — and one preceded
# by a name character is a longer token that merely ends in the name; neither
# is this rename's to change (review findings 1 and 14). Under --dry-run the
# path pass has consumed nothing, so this same rule is what keeps the preview
# equal to the real run (finding 2).
#
# Literal, via index/substr, never sed: OLD is a file name, and the `.` in
# `DRAFT-x.md` is a metacharacter that would match any character. The values
# travel through ENVIRON rather than -v: awk -v processes escape sequences in
# its value, and a file name is not an awk string literal.
