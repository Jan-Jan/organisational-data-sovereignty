# Renames this change's draft ledger files to their merge-dated names:
#   docs/<area>/DRAFT-<branch>-<slug>.md -> docs/<area>/<merge-date>-<slug>.md
# Prints one "before -> after" line per rename. Idempotent: with no draft
# ledger files present it prints nothing.
#
# There are no IDs to finalize. An item is given its ID by new-id.sh when it is
# written, and that ID is allocated against nothing, so nothing has to be
# assigned at merge. Draft ledger FILES are a different problem and remain:
# a change writes its own file so that parallel worktrees never touch one, and
# the merge date cannot be known until the merge.
#
# This script was called finalize-ids.sh until the token scheme landed. It was
# renamed rather than left holding a name for work it no longer does.
#
# Exit codes: 0 success, 2 usage/environment error.
