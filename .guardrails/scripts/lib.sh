# The ID body vocabulary. An item ID is <PREFIX>-<body>, and a body is either
# a minted token or a legacy sequential number.
#
# A token is six characters of an alphabet that drops the pairs a reader
# confuses — 0/o and 1/l/i — with AT LEAST ONE DIGIT. The digit is not
# decoration: without it `REQ-<six letters>` matches ordinary hyphenated
# English, and a `PR-update` in a code comment becomes a DANGLING-REF against
# an item nobody ever wrote.
#
# The classes are ENUMERATED, not ranged. A range expression inside a bracket
# expression is undefined outside the POSIX locale, and these patterns run
# under whatever locale the caller has; enumeration also states which letters
# are missing instead of leaving `[a-hjkmnp-z]` to be worked out.
#
# Variables, not functions: they take no arguments and are pasted into
# patterns at a dozen sites. Assigned unconditionally, never `${X:-...}` — a
# value inherited from the environment could widen or narrow every ID scan in
# the toolkit while each one still exited 0, the same reasoning as
# GR_SCAN_EXCLUDE below.

# of its life, and this pattern is handed to awk as well as to git grep.

# The item-block rule as an awk fragment, defined ONCE and prepended to every
# program that needs it.
#
# An item block OPENS at a well-formed definition for the prefix the gate
# collects, and CLOSES at a markdown heading or at ANY BOLD LINE CARRYING A
# COLON. That is the whole closing rule.
#
# It is stated as a SUBTRACTION, and that framing is the point. Until
# 2026-08-22 the rule closed on every line starting `**`. An emphasised
# sentence inside an item body (`**21 of 35 inverted, 14 not.**`) therefore
# ended the item there, and everything after it — annotations included —
# belonged to no item: UNTRACED-DESIGN and UNSATISFIED-LLR then rejected
# correct documents, while UNANALYZED-DERIVED and UNRESOLVED-PR passed over
# real violations in silence. One rule, four gates, both failure directions.
#
# The close set must therefore be everything that rule closed, MINUS the shape
# that caused the defect, and nothing else. The defect line carries no colon;
# so the colon is the subtraction, and there is no other. Three review rounds
# were spent narrowing instead — to definition forms, then to header shapes,
# then to a colon adjoining the closing asterisks — and each narrowing lost
# lines the old rule closed, which is a regression however small the loss. A
# line a reader takes for a header but the rule does not becomes body text, and
# its annotations are credited to the item ABOVE it: a resolved PR inherits the
# next one`s `status: open`. That is a wrong answer, where the original defect
# gave a missing one.
#
# BYTE-WISE, not a regex, and this is not stylistic. `.` in an ERE does not
# match an invalid byte sequence under gawk in a multibyte locale, so
# `^\*\*.*:` silently stopped closing on a ledger saved in latin-1 — a header
# like `**Détail**:` — while mawk, busybox awk and gawk under LC_ALL=C all
# closed it. The same tree, the same script, two verdicts, decided by the
# operator`s locale. substr and index count bytes in every awk and every
# locale, and they say what the sentence above says.
#
# The residual limit, stated exactly: a bold line carrying no ASCII colon does
# not close. `**Decision 7**` does not; `**Decision 7**:` does. A full-width
# colon (U+FF1A) is not an ASCII colon and does not close. Nothing
# distinguishes a colon-free bold line from the sentence in the original
# report, so that one is irreducible.
#
# One definition, for the same reason GR_AWK_ID_RUN and gr_def_re have one, and
# with one addition: ORPHAN-ANNOTATION is a fifth reader of this rule, and a
# backstop that disagrees with the gates it backs is not a backstop.
#
# gr_block_init takes the OPENING prefix alternation (the prefixes this gate
# collects) and GR_ID_BODY. There is no closing alternation: the close is keyed
# on no vocabulary at all, which is what makes it total. The opening pattern is
# assembled HERE, inside awk, and never handed in ready-made with -v: awk runs
# escape processing over a -v value, so a pattern carrying \* arrives as a bare
# * and matches nothing at all — a gate that counts zero items and still exits
# 0. Measured on gawk 5.3.2. Both arguments carry no backslashes of their own,
# which is what lets them cross the -v boundary safely.

#     reported INCOMPLETE-PROBLEM rather than passing silently.
#   * `traces:` and `satisfies:` — STILL OPEN. They are read by gr_id_run,
#     which finds its keyword ANYWHERE on the line, so `- satisfies: REQ-001`
#     counts inside a block while the same line outside every block is not
#     reported here at all: exit 0 with a derived item never checked against

# again — it fires on any sentence containing the word. Column one is also what
# keeps the indented grammar comments in the ledger templates inert.
#
# The route out, if this is revisited: the templates already tell authors to

# Bounded YAML front matter, as an awk fragment with ONE definition.
#
# A leading front-matter block is document metadata, not ledger prose:
# `status: draft` there is a title-page field, and a scan that reads it as an
# annotation fails a correct document. A gate that requires a field must not
# accept one from the header block either, which is the same rule read the
# other way round.
#
# TWO PASSES, and the second one is what makes the block bounded. Pass one
# finds where the front matter ENDS; pass two skips up to there. A single pass
# with a running flag has no bound, so a leading `---` that is a thematic break
# — or front matter someone half deleted — switches the scan off for the whole
# file, which is the read-matched-and-dropped-in-silence these gates exist to
# remove. With no terminator, GR_FM_END stays 0 and nothing is skipped.

# Only line 1 may OPEN a block; `...` closes one as well as `---`, and a
# trailing CR is tolerated so a document saved with CRLF endings is not read as
# having no front matter at all.

# installed scripts do not report themselves — their comments carry a literal
# `REQ-DRAFT-b-1` and definition-form examples — and the scripts are the only
# thing under `.guardrails/` that matches any gate's pattern; config.yaml
# matches none. Excluding the whole directory also hid the project's own files:
# with `doc_srs: .guardrails/docs/requirements`, the finalize step renamed the
# draft ledger to its merge-date name, minted nothing, and exited 0, and both
# check scripts then passed a tree with a live `REQ-DRAFT-x-1` in it.
# Narrowing cannot reach one case: a doc_* configured INSIDE this directory is

# check-trace.sh cannot do, setting IFS to newline at top level. Assigned unconditionally, never `${GR_SCAN_EXCLUDE:-…}`: a value

# gr_def_re ALTERNATION [POSITION] — ERE matching an item definition
# line: a bold ID followed immediately by a colon, at line start.
#
# One constructor because two scripts must agree about the same string:
# check-ids.sh decides what is a duplicate and what is malformed, and
# check-trace.sh decides what exists at all. There was a third — the old
# finalize-ids.sh decided what number came next — and while the three
# disagreed, that one alone matched the form UNANCHORED, so a token in prose
# raised a mint ceiling neither gate could see. The ceiling is gone with
# sequential numbering; the constructor stays, because two readers of one
# string is exactly how that drift started.
#
# POSITION is spliced in front and defaults to `^`. Pass '^\+' or '^-' to scan
# `git diff` output, where a definition sits at line start behind a + or -, and
# the empty string to match the token anywhere on a line. Do NOT express that
# last case as '^.+': git's matcher backtracks on a leading .+ and costs tens
# of seconds per prefix on a few hundred documents, against tenths of a second
# for the unanchored form. The verification record carries the measurement and
# the corpus commit it was taken on; a bare number here could not be re-derived
# and drifted into three different values.

#
# The complement of gr_def_re over the same anchor. A line this matches and
# gr_def_re does not is a definition form whose ID cannot be read, and there is
# no third possibility — which is what makes "loose minus strict" a total
# classification of DEFINITION-SHAPED lines. It is not a classification of
# header-shaped ones, and that distinction is the whole of the 2026-08-23
# amendment: `**ADR-0007**:` is a header this pattern does not match.
#
# ONE consumer: the MALFORMED-ID scan in check-ids.sh, which spelled the
# pattern out by hand until 2026-08-23. There such a line is a document defect
# — the item it announces is invisible to every gate — and it is reported at
# exit 1.
#
# check-trace.sh does NOT use it, though two earlier designs did. A pre-flight
# refusing such trees outright was written and cut, and the block rule closes
# on a header SHAPE, which is broader and keyed on no vocabulary. Kept as a
# constructor rather than folded back inline because MALFORMED-ID is the
# complement of gr_def_re over one anchor, and the two belong next to each
