# find-items.sh list [--kind PREFIX]... [--status open|accepted|resolved]
# find-items.sh show ID
# find-items.sh refs ID
#
# Finds items in the ledgers, so that an agent reads one item and not a whole
# ledger file.
#
#   list  One line per item defined in the doc_* files of this config:
#         ID, status, file:line of the definition, and the rest of the
#         definition line. The status is the first column-one `status:` line in
#         the item block, the line check-trace.sh reads, or `-` when the block
#         has none. --kind keeps the items of one declared prefix; given
#         more than once, it keeps the items of each prefix it names. --status
#         keeps the items with that status, and is given at most once. An
#         empty --kind or --status is a usage error.
#   show  The block of every definition of ID, each after a line
#         `==> file:line`, with a blank line between two blocks. A block ends
#         where the gates end it, by the shared GR_AWK_ITEM_BLOCK fragment in
#         lib.sh: at a heading, at the next bold line that contains a colon,
#         or at the end of the file. Blank lines at the end of a block are not
#         printed.
#   refs  Every file:line:text in the working tree, tracked or untracked and
#         not ignored, that contains ID as a whole word, except its definition
#         lines. A definition line is one that opens with **ID**:, after an
#         optional byte order mark, in any file: a definition outside the
#         ledgers is not printed either. check-ids.sh reports a second
#         definition as DUPLICATE-ID, and check-trace.sh reports an item
#         defined only outside its ledger as MISPLACED-ITEM. The carriage
#         return of a CRLF line is not printed. Binary files are skipped. It
#         searches the whole repository, not one unit. The output does not
#         follow the user git config: a non-ASCII file name is printed as
#         its bytes, with no column number and no color. git still prints a
#         file name that contains a tab, a newline, a double quote or a
#         backslash in double quotes, with C escapes.
#
# Under a unit manifest, set GR_CONFIG to the unit config, as for the check
# scripts. This script checks nothing: its exit status states whether the
# request was answered, not whether the ledgers are correct.
#
# Exit codes: 0 answered, 1 show found no definition of ID, 2 usage/environment
# error.
