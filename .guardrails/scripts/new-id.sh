# new-id.sh PREFIX [COUNT]
#
# Prints COUNT (default 1) freshly minted item IDs for PREFIX, one per line.
# The ID is minted once, when the item is written, and never recomputed — it
# is deliberately NOT a content hash, which would change under an edit and
# break every `verifies:` and `traces:` reference pointing at it.
#
# Nothing allocates these against a base branch, which is the whole point:
# two worktrees, or two GitHub PRs, mint independently and never contend.
#
# Collisions are DETECTED, not prevented. A candidate already present anywhere
# in this tree — tracked or untracked, definition or reference — is discarded
# and another drawn. A collision with an ID that exists only on another branch
# cannot be seen from here; it is caught by DUPLICATE-ID in check-ids.sh, which
# merge-change runs after it has merged the base branch into the worktree.
# At a thousand items the probability of one is under 0.1%, and the failure
# mode is a loud red rather than a wrong ID.
#
# Exit codes: 0 success, 2 usage/environment error.

    # six usable bytes appear, which never happens on a source that is readable
    # but yields nothing usable — /dev/zero, /dev/null, a directory, a short
    # regular file. The [ -r ] guard above passes for all of them, and
    # new-id.sh hung forever. Reading one block instead returns on EOF or a
    # short read, and a draw of fewer than six characters is rejected by the
    # length check at the call site like any other malformed one.
    #
    # This bounds the read, NOT the wait. A source that blocks rather than
    # returning short — /dev/random on an entropy-starved host — still waits
    # here, because one dd is still one blocking read(). That is the documented
    # behaviour of such a device and not something to work around without a
    # portable timeout; it is recorded as a gap in the verification record. A
    # FIFO, the other blocking case, is refused above.

    # block yields ~496 usable characters over the shipped 31-symbol alphabet,
