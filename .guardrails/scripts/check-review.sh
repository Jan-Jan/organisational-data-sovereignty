#
# The review artefact gate. Independent review (merge-change step 6a) is the
# highest-yield step in the sequence and was the only one with nothing behind
# it: no check that a reviewer was dispatched, that findings were answered, or
# that the record says anything at all. Reported by a class B project running
# sixty-nine verification records entirely on the honour system.
#
# Fails (exit 1) on:
#   MISSING-RECORD BRANCH — no record in doc_verification declares this change.
#   INCOMPLETE-RECORD FILE (no KEYWORD:) — the record for this change omits a
#                            required field, or carries it with no value. An
#                            empty `reproduced:` is an omission wearing the
#                            shape of compliance and is reported as one.
#   UNDISPOSED-FINDING FILE:LINE ID — a finding block in this change's record
#                            with no `disposition:` in it. "A verdict per
#                            finding": the failure reported was a fix to a
#                            previous round's finding being half-applied.
#   MALFORMED-FINDING FILE:LINE — a line SHAPED like a finding header whose
#                            label cannot be read: a missing colon, a missing
#                            hyphen, an unreadable body, an indented header.
#                            Such a line opens no block, so the finding is
#                            invisible and its disposition is credited to
#                            whatever block happens to be open.
#   ORPHAN-DISPOSITION FILE:LINE — a `disposition:` at column one belonging to
#                            no finding block. The backstop for every shape of
#                            detached finding the rule above cannot name, and
#                            the same mechanism check-trace.sh calls
#                            ORPHAN-ANNOTATION.
#   STALE-RECORD FILE — a record declaring this branch that this change did not
#                            write or touch. A reused branch name would
#                            otherwise let the previous change's record answer
#                            for this one.
#
# This gate judges PRESENCE, NEVER QUALITY. It cannot know whether a review was
# good, or whether a reviewer was independent of the author — with agent
# reviewers the identity string is whatever the author types, and a gate keyed
# on it would be theatre. It knows whether a review is claimed, by whom, with
# what conclusion, and whether every finding it raised was answered.
#
# Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 violations, 2 usage/environment error.
