#
# Verifies commit signatures. Default scope: HEAD only; pass a rev range
# (e.g. main..feature) to check every commit in it.
#
#   pass            — signature verifies against trusted signers (%G? = G)
#   WARN-UNVERIFIED — signature present, did not verify; passes unless --strict
#   UNVERIFIED      — signature present, did not verify; fails. Under --strict
#                     this is the strict form of WARN-UNVERIFIED; for a
#                     signature the verifier REJECTED or could not run at all
#                     (%G? = B/X/Y/R) it is unconditional, in both modes, and
#                     there is no WARN- counterpart.
#   UNSIGNED        — no signature at all; fails
#
# Every non-passing verdict is followed by the verifier's own output, indented
# under it. `git log --format=%G?` answers with one letter and discards what
# the verifier said, so the reason is asked for separately rather than guessed
# at.
#
# --setup answers a different question: not "is this history signed" but "can
# this project sign at all", which is what a merge gate depends on before there
# is anything to gate.
#
#   MISSING     — a setting a verifiable signature needs is not configured
#   UNREADABLE  — the trust root is configured but cannot be read
#   UNPROVED    — configured, but a real signed commit did not come out of it
#
# A trust root that is configured and present but that the process lacks
# permission to read — a chmod'd signers file, an unreadable ~/.gnupg — is
# exit 2 in EVERY mode, never UNVERIFIED/UNREADABLE at exit 1: exit 1 says
# "the project is wrong", and there only the environment is.

# Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 violations, 2 usage/environment error.

# this script used to supply one by guessing — it appended the
# gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile remedy to every verdict alike, including the
# OpenPGP ones where nothing reads that setting. A repository's history can be
# signed BOTH ways (this one is: measured 2026-09-01, 17 ssh to 3 OpenPGP in
# the last 20 commits), and the two formats then fail to verify for entirely
# different reasons behind one identical line (PR-52rnrn).
# `git verify-commit` runs the same
# verification and lets the verifier's own words through, so ask it rather
# than guess. Called only on a verdict that already failed, so the extra fork
# costs nothing on a passing run.

# nothing about whether the key can sign or the signature verifies, and only a
# real signature answers that.
