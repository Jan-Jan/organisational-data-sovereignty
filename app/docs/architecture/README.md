# Architecture ledger

This directory is a per-change ledger: each merged change contributes one
dated file, `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` (merge date, assigned by `merge-change`
from your worktree's `DRAFT-<branch>-<slug>.md`). **Edit existing items in
the file that defines them.** Use this README's Overview section for the
system-wide decomposition picture; `soup.md` (single file) holds the SOUP
inventory.

<!--
Item grammar (enforced by .guardrails/scripts/check-trace.sh):

  **SDD-NNNNNN**: <software item and its responsibility>. traces: REQ-NNNNNN[, REQ-...]

Low-level requirements (design data — the directly codeable refinement of
the high-level REQs), written under the software item they belong to:

  **LLR-NNNNNN**: <directly codeable behavior>. satisfies: REQ-NNNNNN[, REQ-...]
  **LLR-NNNNNN**: <behavior with no parent requirement>. satisfies: derived

- Every design item must trace to at least one requirement.
- Every LLR satisfies a REQ or is marked derived; derived LLRs must be
  assessed in the risk ledger.
- Tests verify LLRs where they exist; the parent REQ is covered
  transitively.
- Class C items require LLRs (interfaces, algorithms, error behavior,
  resource limits — one testable LLR each); class B optional per item.
- If an item's safety class differs from the project default, state it in the
  item text (IEC 62304 allows per-item classification).
- Mint the ID when you write the item: run
  `.guardrails/scripts/new-id.sh <PREFIX>` and paste what it prints. Never
  invent one by hand.
- IDs in the examples above use `NNNNNN` as a placeholder, and the examples
  are indented. Both matter. A real ID here would be a reference to an item
  that does not exist, reported as `DANGLING-REF` on every run; and a
  definition form at COLUMN ONE is judged whatever its body, so an example
  written flush left is reported as `MALFORMED-ID` — inside a fenced code
  block too, because no gate in the toolkit parses fences. Indent illustrative
  forms, or keep them inline in backticks. A real ID is six characters of
  `23456789abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyz` with at least one digit; `new-id.sh` draws
  it for you.

     between items of different safety classes (if any). -->
